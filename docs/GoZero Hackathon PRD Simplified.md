# GoZero PRD - Current Implementation

## Problem \& Solution

**Problem**: People don't know how to properly recycle items, leading to increased waste and missed environmental impact opportunities.

**Solution**: AI-powered mobile web app that scans items, categorizes them for recycling, and connects to GoSend for pickup while tracking environmental impact.

## Current Implementation Status

- ✅ Working AI item scanner with support for common waste materials
- ✅ Complete user journey: scan → categorize → order pickup → see impact
- ✅ Image optimization to handle large file uploads (especially from iPhones)
- ✅ Backend configured to handle larger payloads (10MB limit)
- ✅ Environmental impact calculation and visualization


## Core User Journey (Implemented)

1. User scans waste item with phone camera or uploads an image
2. Client compresses the image to optimize for upload (480px width, 0.6 quality)
3. AI identifies material and recycling category
4. App shows detailed disposal instructions and environmental impact potential
5. User orders GoSend pickup with specified location
6. System displays contribution (CO2 saved, water saved, energy saved)

## Implemented Features

- **AI Item Scanner**: Camera integration with multimodal model that supports both camera capture and file uploads
- **Smart Categorization**: Material type identification (plastic, metal, paper, glass, electronics) with specific recycling instructions
- **Impact Calculator**: CO2, water, and energy savings calculations and display
- **GoSend Integration**: Pickup order interface with location selection
- **Dashboard**: Scan history and cumulative environmental impact tracking
- **Image Optimization**: Client-side compression to handle large image uploads
- **Chatbot**: AI-powered assistance for recycling questions
- **Disposal Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for proper item disposal


## Success Metrics

- Successful identification of common household waste items
- Optimized image handling to prevent upload failures
- <3 second response time for AI identification (after image upload)
- Smooth user experience across different devices
- Clear disposal instructions for identified items
- Accurate environmental impact calculations


## Technical Stack (Implemented)

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, mobile-first responsive design
- **UI Components**: Custom components with accessibility features
- **Backend**: Express server with optimized payload handling (10MB limit)
- **Image Processing**: Client-side compression for optimal performance
- **AI**: Multimodal image recognition model for waste identification
- **Storage**: Database for scan history, user data, and environmental impact
- **Maps**: Integration for recycling center locations and pickup services


## Key Challenges \& Solutions

**Large Image File Uploads**:

- *Solution*: Implemented client-side image compression to 480px width and 0.6 JPEG quality
- *Solution*: Increased Express server payload limits to 10MB for both JSON and URL-encoded data

**AI Analysis Accuracy**:

- *Solution*: Enhanced disposal instructions with material-specific fallbacks
- *Solution*: Implemented detailed step-by-step guides for proper recycling

**User Experience**:

- *Solution*: Added loading states during image analysis
- *Solution*: Implemented error handling for failed uploads or analysis
- *Solution*: Optimized camera interface with file upload alternative

**Environmental Impact Calculation**:

- *Solution*: Developed detailed metrics for CO2, water, and energy savings


## Current Focus Areas

- **Performance Optimization**: Further image compression improvements and payload handling
- **AI Accuracy**: Enhancing waste identification for more specific categories
- **User Experience**: Refining the scanning and pickup workflow
- **Environmental Impact**: Expanding impact metrics and visualizations
- **Database**: Optimizing storage and retrieval of scan history
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring smooth experience across all device types


## Current Success Definition

A fully functional application that provides accurate waste identification, clear recycling instructions, and meaningful environmental impact metrics while maintaining excellent performance across different devices and handling various image upload scenarios efficiently.
