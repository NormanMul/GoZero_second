Problem & Solution
Problem: People don't know how to properly recycle/reuse/reduce items, leading to increased waste and missed environmental impact opportunities.
Solution: AI-powered mobile web app that scans items, categorizes them for recycling, reuse and reduce and connects to GoSend for pickup while tracking environmental impact.
Hackathon Goals Build working AI item scanner with >80% accuracy on common items
Demonstrate complete user journey: scan → categorize → order pickup → see impact calculation -> get report/incentive based on recommendation
Integrate pre-trained multimodal AI via Alibaba Cloud QWEN API
Core User Journey
User scans or photo waste item with phone camera
AI identifies material and recycling category
App shows environmental impact potential
User orders GoSend pickup with one click
System displays contribution (CO2 saved, waste diverted),
6 can use QR for payment
Hackathon MVP Features (Must-Have)
AI Item Scanner: Camera integration with pre-trained multimodal model(qwen visual latest one)
Smart Categorization: Material type identification (plastic, metal, paper, electronics)
Impact Calculator: Simple CO2/waste savings display
GoSend Mockup: Pickup order interface (demo-ready, not full integration)
Dashboard: Scan history and cumulative impact
Success Metrics for Demo
Scan 50+ different items during development
<3 second response time for AI identification
Smooth demo flow without crashes
Clear value proposition demonstration
Technical Stack
Frontend: Next.js mobile web app or python for backend
AI: using  fastAPI and qwen model (use this QWEN api key)
